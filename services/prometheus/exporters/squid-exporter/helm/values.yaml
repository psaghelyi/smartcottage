  # Service settings below are applicable only if
  # service.type is one of [LoadBalancer, NodePort] and not ClusterIP.
  # Possible values are [Cluster, Local].
  # If set to Local, then the Service's port will be available only on Kubernetes
  # Nodes which have the Squid Pods so no Kubernetes Node-to-Node traffic will be forwarded.
  # If set to Cluster, then the Service's port will be available on any Node of
  # a Kubernetes cluster. The drawback is that Kubernetes will use double NAT
  # so it will hide the Client source IP from Squid.
